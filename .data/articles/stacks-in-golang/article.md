## Introduction

Stacks are fundamental data structures that operate on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are widely used in various applications, such as expression evaluation, function call management, and backtracking algorithms. In this article, we will delve into the implementation of stacks in Golang and understand how to perform basic operations like push, pop, and peek.

## Understanding Stacks

A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top element from the stack. Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. In this article, we will focus on implementing stacks using linked lists for their flexibility and dynamic sizing.

### Step 1: Define the Stack Structure

In Golang, defining a stack involves creating a struct to represent the nodes. Here's an example:

```go
type Node struct {
    Data interface{}
    Next *Node
}

type Stack struct {
    Top  *Node
    Size int
}
```

### Step 2: Implement Basic Stack Operations

#### Push:

```go
func (s *Stack) Push(data interface{}) {
    newNode := &Node{Data: data}
    newNode.Next = s.Top
    s.Top = newNode
    s.Size++
}
```

#### Pop:

```go
func (s *Stack) Pop() (interface{}, bool) {
    if s.Top == nil {
        return nil, false
    }
    data := s.Top.Data
    s.Top = s.Top.Next
    s.Size--
    return data, true
}
```

#### Peek:

```go
func (s *Stack) Peek() (interface{}, bool) {
    if s.Top == nil {
        return nil, false
    }
    return s.Top.Data, true
}
```

## Conclusion

Stacks are powerful data structures that enable efficient management of elements in a Last-In, First-Out manner. By understanding the basic concepts and implementing stacks in Golang, you have acquired a valuable tool for solving problems that require backtracking, expression evaluation, and function call management. Experiment with different variations of stacks, such as implementing them with arrays, and explore advanced features like handling multiple stacks simultaneously. Mastering stacks will enhance your problem-solving skills and broaden your understanding of data structures in computer science. Happy coding!
